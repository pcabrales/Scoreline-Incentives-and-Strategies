# Final Year Physics Project: Data Science in Football

## Project Title
**Scoreline Incentives and Strategies**

## Overview
This project explores the application of data science in football to analyze and quantify team strategies and incentives based on game situations. The project aimed to develop a metric that measures a team's **offensive intent** during matches.

## Objectives
- Develop a metric to quantify a football team's **aggression** or offensive intent.
- Use machine learning techniques to analyze team behavior at different stages of a match.
- Predict success metrics based on team aggression levels, providing insights into strategic decision-making in football.

## Key Features
- **Neural Networks**: Utilized **TensorFlow** to build and train neural network models.
- **Aggression Metric**: Engineered features that quantify offensive intent during football matches.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Investigated the relationship between aggression and success at various stages of a game.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Processed match data with Spark to extract relevant features representing offensive intent.
   - Engineered custom features to measure aggression in different game scenarios.

2. **Modeling**:
   - Built neural network models in TensorFlow to analyze the impact of offensive strategies.
   - Used supervised learning techniques to predict the likelihood of success based on aggression levels.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Tested the model's performance using key match outcomes and metrics.
   - Iteratively refined the aggression metric to ensure alignment with football gameplay strategies.

## Results
- Successfully developed a metric to measure offensive intent (98% accuracy at Ã±ate match stages), providing actionable insights for teams.
- Demonstrated the predictive power of aggression metrics in determining success at various game stages.
- Highlighted the impact of data-driven approaches on decision-making in football strategy.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow** for neural network implementation
- **Spark** for data processing
- **Data Science Libraries**: NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn

## Significance
This project bridges the fields of physics, data science, and sports analytics, showcasing the potential of machine learning in transforming strategic understanding and performance analysis in professional football.
